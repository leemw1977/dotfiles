# My personal dot files
Here are my zshrc and ps profile

I use posh-git & oh-my-posh

I'm still currenty having issues with SSH on a few of my accessing devices - I hope to solve this problem in the coming weeks.

* `.zshrc` is my zsh profile - standing on the shoulders of the great powerline9k
* `alteredbeast.psm1` is a theme for oh-my-posh based on the brilliant agnoster theme - I've added the date/time here
* `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` is my PS profile, contents of which is symlinked to where `$PROFILE` points.
